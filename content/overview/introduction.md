This collaborative web page attempts to be a comprehensive overview of different Bitcoin
[**covenant**](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/covenants/) use cases and consensus change proposals.

Use the side-bar to explore the different use cases and proposals or check out the
[summary table](/overview/summary).


### Contributing

This web page is definitely not a finished work. Since it is collaborative, everyone is very much
invited to contribute to it [on GitHub](https://github.com/stevenroose/covenants.info)!

Apart from content contributors, some help would also be appreciated on the website. We currently use the
static site generator [Zola](https://getzola.org/) and the [AdiDoks](https://adidoks.org/) theme.
