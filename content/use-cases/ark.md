## Introduction

Ark is a newly proposed layer two protocol that aims to enable the ability to make cheap off-chain
transactions while not suffering from the same adoption difficulties as the Lightning Network:
inbound liquidity and channel management. It relies on a central service provider to condense an
unlimited number of transactions of so-called virtual UTXOs (VTXOs) that happen off-chain into a
single on-chain transaction. Because Ark is inter-operable with the Lightning Network, Ark users can
also send and receive Lightning payments.

Ark is currently still in design phase and no specification or implementation exists to date.


## Technical Requirements

In theory it is possible to build Ark on Bitcoin without covenants, but with the use of [transaction
templating](/use-cases/tx-templating), the protocol becomes a lot less interactive.

Therefore, ideally Ark would be built on some transaction templating mechanism. It would be possible
to use [CTV](/proposals/ctv), but ideally something more flexible like
[TXHASH](/proposals/txhash) would be preferred.
